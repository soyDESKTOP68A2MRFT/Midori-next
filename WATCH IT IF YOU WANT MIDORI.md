# Midori-next
this is a repo for the last version of midori next (which is in my posession) 
and which is practicaly unbuildable (at least when i tried to build it with npm 
it gave me an error) 
so there is a google drive link for the interested people

if you have doubts about how i get the mentioned package.7z file i got it from a instalation of midori
(from when the page of astian worked) and because of midori was made in electron it left a folder called "midori-updater"
and on it was a file called "package.7z" so for that reason i have that specific version of midori

PS: IT'S JUST FOR WINDOWS I DON'T HAVE ANY LINUX INSTALATION (but im interested in try linux)
